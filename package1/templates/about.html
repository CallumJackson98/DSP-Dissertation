    <h3>A system to influence/manipulate the emotions of twitter users through auto-generated posts made by a machine-learning enhanced bot.</h3>
    <br></br>
    <h8>Social media is a platform that has offered an unprecedented level of manipulability of individuals at a massive scale through automation of targeting demographics whether it be to influence their political opinion or to direct more effective targeted advertising. Does this need another sentence to bridge these two parts?
        Using datasets of Twitter posts with existing sentiment analysis, I will build a system that can generate posts to provoke emotive responses. The system will allow its user to choose emotions and target groups and, using machine learning techniques, will analyse its effectiveness and hone its future posts.</h8>
